EDI Chat App â€“ v0.1
A minimal AI-powered web companion for those feeling lonely, low, or just in need of a voice.

ðŸŒ± About
EDI (Emotive Dialogue Interface) is a voice-enabled AI chat platform designed to offer comfort, presence, and grounded interaction. Itâ€™s not therapy. Itâ€™s not a substitute for crisis care. Itâ€™s simply someone to talk to â€” without judgement, expectation, or labels.

ðŸ›  Built With
Node.js + Express (backend)

HTML/CSS/JS (frontend UI)

OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo / GPT-4o (AI)

Web Speech API (text-to-speech)

Memory Lite (localStorage-based session memory)

Carrd (front-facing trust/landing page)

Render (hosting backend)

Replit (development and test environment)

ðŸ”’ Ethics & Privacy
EDI doesnâ€™t store personal data or conversations. All chat history is stored locally in your browser.
No analytics, no ads, no tracking. We donâ€™t know who you are, and thatâ€™s the point.
